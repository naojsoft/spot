images and overlay instrument fields of view. 

Spot is written and maintained by software engineers at the
Subaru Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and the
Space Telescope Science Institute. The code is released as open-source
under a BSD license and maintained at https://github.com/naojsoft/spot.
