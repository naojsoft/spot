About
=====

Spot is a graphical tool created to assist with planning and 
conducting astronomical observations.  It can display the telescope 
targets and telescope position on a polar sky plot, and plot the 
visibilty of targets. SPOT can also be setup to look up catalog 
images and overlay instrument fields of view. 

Spot is written and maintained by software engineers at the
Subaru Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, and the
Space Telescope Science Institute. The code is released as open-source
under a BSD license and maintained at https://github.com/naojsoft/spot.
