PolarSky draws a polar plot on the "<wsname>_TGTS" window, takes care of
plotting objects there and also shows a small window with an astronomical
almanac info (sun set/rise, moon set/rise, twilights, etc).

Since the polar plot guides are useful in interpreting the plots of
targets, etc. you will usually want to start this plugin if you are
planning to also use the ``Targets`` or ``Visibility`` plugins.
If you are not interested in the almanac info you can minimize the
plugin UI after starting it.

PolarSky Window

The PolarSky channel contains time information for the site, the sun, and 
the moon. Under "Site Date/Time", it has the date in yyyy-mm-dd, local time 
and time zone, UTC time and date in mm/dd, and LST.

The Sun section displays the Sunset and Sunrise along with the Night center 
time.
