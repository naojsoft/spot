Spot is a graphical tool created to help observers plan and conduct astronomical 
observations. 

Spot centers around a sky window which can display targets from a csv or ope file 
along with recent allsky images from the telescope site. It supports:

- Zooming and panning
- Color and intensity mapping
- Plotting targets from csv and ope files

It also contains a display for showing catalog images, which can be setup to 
include instrument field of view overlays on top, and a target visiblity chart 
for tracking the elevation of targets over time.
