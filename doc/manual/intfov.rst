Instrument FOV
++++++++++++++

The Instrument FOV plugin is used to overlay the field of view of an 
instrument over a survey image in the Finding Chart channel. 

========================
Selecting the Instrument
========================

The instrument can be selected from the drop down menu. A red outline 
of the instrument's field of view will appear in the Finding Chart 
channel. The position angle can be adjusted, rotating the survey 
image relative to the instrument overlay. The image can be flipped 
across the vertical axis by checking the ``Flip`` box.

The RA and DEC will be autofilled by the ``Find Image`` channel, but 
can also be adjusted manually by entering in the coordinates. The
RA and DEC can be specified as decimal values or sexigesimal notation.
