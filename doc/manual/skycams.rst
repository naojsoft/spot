Sky Cams

The SkyCam plugin is used to place a camera image on the background of 
the Targets channel to monitor sky conditions. There is a drop-down menu 
with several sites to choose from.

Setting the Sky Image
=====================

Select the camera server you would like to use from the drop down menu 
under "All Sky Camera". Then, press the checkbox next to "Show Sky Image" 
to display the image in the Targets channel. It may take a few moments 
before the sky image appears in the channel. When the image updates, 
the time and date of the last image will be displayed at the bottom of the 
window underneath "Image Download Info".

The SkyCam plugin can also generate a differential image from the selected 
channel server by selecting the checkbox next to "Show Differential Image".
