Telescope Position
++++++++++++++++++

The telescope position plugin displays the telescope and 
target positions. 

.. image:: figures/telpos2.*

The telescope and target positions are shown in both 
Right Ascension/Declination and Azimuth/Elevation.
RA and DEC are displayed in sexigesimal notation as 
HH:MM:SS.SSS for RA, and DD:MM:SS.SS for DEC. 
AZ and EL are both displayed in degrees as decimal 
values. 
In the "Telescope" section, the telescope status, such as 
pointing or slewing, is shown along with the slew time in 
h:mm:ss.

The "Plot telescope position" button will show the 
Target and Telescope positions on the Targets window when 
the button is selected. 

The "Rotate view to azimuth" button will orient the Targets 
window so the telescope azimuth is always facing towards the 
top of the screen.
